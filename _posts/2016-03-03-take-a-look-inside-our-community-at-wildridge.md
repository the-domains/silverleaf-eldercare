# Take a Look Inside our Community at Wildridge

**Creature Comforts. Certified care. Social connection.**
![Welcome to Silverleaf Eldercare @ Wildridge](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/52b7a5aecd23318891dc942f183cc0afa0944a56.jpg)

Our large, single story home in the Northwest Hills neighborhood of Austin has been intelligently re-designed by award winning Matt Fajkus Architecture.

In the central hub of activity, you'll find two large living spaces divided by a central hearth and adjoined by an open dining area and kitchen. Wrap-around windows in second living space and dining area give an indoor / outdoor feel and connection with nature.

Oak trees provide shade for relaxation on the back deck. And the private backyard is awash in color from the flowering gardens, raised vegetable beds, and activity at the birdfeeders.

There are two wings off either side of the activity hub where residents' rooms can be found. A range of room types are available, from shared rooms with double beds to private rooms. And there are a few premium rooms with their own bathrooms for extra privacy.

**Whatever your preference, you'll find that Silverleaf Eldercare assisted living at Wildridge is a great choice for comfort, care, and social connection.**
