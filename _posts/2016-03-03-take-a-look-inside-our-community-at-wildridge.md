# Take a Look Inside our Community at Wildridge

Creature Comforts, certified care, social connection

Our 3500 square foot, single story home has been intelligently re-designed by award winning Matt Fajkus Architects.

In the central hub of activity, you'll find two large living spaces divided by a central hearth and adjoined by an open dining area and kitchen. Wrap-around windows in second living space and dining area give an indoor / outdoor feel and connection with nature.

Oak trees provide shade for relaxation on the back deck. And the private backyard is awash in color from the flowering gardens and activity at the birdfeeders.

There are two wings off either side of the activity hub where residents' rooms can be found. A range of room types are available, from shared rooms with double beds to private rooms. And there are a few premium rooms with their own bathrooms for extra privacy.
