# Welcome to Silverleaf Eldercare!

**Where we believe the Golden Years deserve a silver lining**
![Laughter is the best medicine](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b5e1a369-1a1f-468c-b54a-36de86f9c6d9.jpg)

You have many choices to make as you and your loved ones get older and need more attention and care. Some people prefer a large community that starts from a place of active retirement. Others might wish to stay in their own homes as long as possible. 

The family at **Silverleaf Eldercare** strives to give you the best of both those options. Our home at Wildridge in the Northwest Hills neighborhood of Austin gives you attentive care and attention twenty four hours a day in a comfortable, recognizable setting. With just 12 residents to care for, our certified caregivers are there any moment you need them.

Here are just a few of the amenities you'll enjoy at Silverleaf Eldercare:

* Your choice of a shared, private, or private room with private bathroom.
* **Organic foods****delivered fresh from our ****partners at local organic farms**. Hippocrates said that food is the best medicine, and we believe it is as true today as it was a few thousand years ago. 
* **Chefs** who prepare healthy and tasty meal plans.
* **Activities for the body** - elder yoga & tai chi, herb and flower gardening in our backyard raised beds...
* **Activities for the mind and spirit** - adult coloring books, pet therapy, live music, holiday parties... Laughter is good medicine too!
