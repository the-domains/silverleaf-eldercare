# Welcome to Silverleaf Eldercare!

You have many choices to make as you and your loved ones get older and need more attention and care. Some people prefer a large community that starts from a place of active retirement. Others might wish to stay in their own homes as long as possible.

The family at **Silverleaf Eldercare strives to give you the best of both those options.**

In our community you will form bonds of friendship and camaraderie with your fellow residents and our kind, well-trained staff. **There's no substitute for social connection. And at Silverleaf Eldercare at Wildridge, there's no worry of being lost in the crowd.**
