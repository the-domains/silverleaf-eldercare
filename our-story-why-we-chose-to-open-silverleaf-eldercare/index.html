communities in residential neighborhoods existed. But then that is probably the way it is for everyone, until they realize they need some help taking care of an older member of the family.</p><p>We tried in-home care for a while, but a few hours of help here and there just wasn't enough to relieve the burden of around-the-clock caregiving. </p><p>Michelle's dad has one of those degenerative memory ailments. No matter what the label -- Alzheimer's, Lewy Body Disease, Dementia, etc. -- the issues are similar. We live in another city, so Michelle's mom had taken on the duty of full-time care for her spouse. She's a small lady, so bathing and dressing her husband was a difficult feat of strength and will. It's tough and takes a toll to care for another person so much that you can't really take care of yourself. No weekends. No time off.</p><p>I'm sure many of you can relate.</p><p>So we made the tough decision and started looking for a place where he could get the 24/7 care he needed from energetic staff who were well-trained to deal with his specific issues. </p><p>Initially we placed him in a large, VA approved assisted living / skilled nursing facility. He's a proud veteran and we hoped it would be a place he could settle into with little resistance. We quickly found it to be a nightmare. I won't go into all the details. Just know we needed to make a change fast.</p><p>We dug in again to figure out what ALL our options were. We felt like 5-year-olds going to the first day of kindergarten. The VA place was far away, it was huge and noisy, and there were too many staff. My father-in-law was disoriented and often frightened. So we knew we wanted something smaller and closer to home, if that was even possible. </p><p>And that's when we found out that dad could live in a house, so very much like the one they had lived in for 40 years, and still get the kind of care we could all be happy about. Plus, the drive for Michelle's mom would be short enough for her to visit her husband pretty much every day. </p><p>Assisted Living for us has created the best life for our parents within the set of circumstances that the world has put before us. Dealing with the inevitable signposts of aging isn't always easy, but it's comforting to know that there are people who care and places designed to help ease the strain and worry.</p><p>That's why we chose to create Silverleaf Eldercare, Residential Assisted Living in Austin, TX. We want to be an integral part of the community where we live. We want to pay it forward. It's our mission to create a healthy, safe, socially connected space where your loved ones will thrive. </p><blockquote><p>Your Golden Years Deserve a Silver Lining!</p></blockquote></div></article></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="64"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="65"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="66"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="67"><span data-reactid="68"><!-- react-empty: 69 --><h2 data-reactid="70"><a data-reactid="71">Silverleaf Eldercare</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="72"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="73"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="74"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="75"></div></section></div></div>
